.SYNOPSIS
    Resolve `policy.pr.defaults.mode` for the pre-merge policy router in
    github-pr.yaml and ado-pr.yaml (AB#3184).
.DESCRIPTION
    Invoked by the `pr_pre_merge_policy_router` step that fronts every
    auto-merge path into `pr_merger`. Calls `polyphony policy resolve
    --domain pr --scope <scope>`, extracts `mode`, and emits a JSON
    envelope the workflow can consume.

    Same defensive posture as `resolve-research-policy.ps1` and
    `resolve-unattended-cap-mode.ps1`:
      - Always exits 0; routing is condition-based, not exit-code-based.
      - On error, `mode` flips to `'manual'` so the failure surfaces at
        the next human gate rather than silently auto-merging with a
        broken policy.
      - `source` and `policy_error` fields let `pr_pre_merge_gate`
        surface "policy resolution failed; falling back to manual" so a
        typo in policy.yaml doesn't hide silently behind the default.

    Allowed `mode` values (from src/Polyphony/Policy/PolicyMode.cs):
      - `auto`    → never gate; auto-merge as soon as reviewer is green
                    (current behavior).
      - `warning` → currently aliases `auto`. Without
                    `quality_threshold` wiring (tracked under AB#3217)
                    there is no second sufficiency check to defer the
                    merge on, so warning has no extra effect today.
                    Documented in the workflow comments.
      - `manual`  → always gate at `pr_pre_merge_gate` before invoking
                    `pr_merger` on the auto-merge path.

    AB#3184 intentionally wires ONLY mode here. quality_threshold and
    max_fix_loops require reviewer-output schema work tracked under
    AB#3217. `max_remediation_cycles` is already consumed elsewhere by
    `pr_remediation_policy` (PR #405).

    Output JSON envelope:
        {
          "mode":         "auto" | "warning" | "manual",
          "source":       "policy" | "default" | "error",
          "policy_error": "<message>"               # empty unless source=='error'
        }

    `source` semantics:
      - `policy`  → `polyphony policy resolve` returned a valid envelope
                    with non-null `mode`.
      - `default` → CLI succeeded but `mode` was missing / null. Should
                    not happen in practice since PolicyLoader stamps
                    defaults at load time (`pr.defaults.mode = warning`)
                    but defended here so a stripped policy can't
                    silently change behavior.
      - `error`   → CLI failed, JSON was malformed, exited non-zero, or
                    the value was outside the allowed domain.
                    `policy_error` carries the message for the gate
                    prompt to render.
.NOTES
    Companion to `pr_pre_merge_policy_router` in github-pr.yaml and
    ado-pr.yaml. The output schema is the workflow's input schema for
    the pre-merge mode-routing leg; the helper Pester tests pin both
    shapes.
.PARAMETER PolyphonyExe
    Path or command to invoke for the polyphony CLI. Defaults to
    'polyphony' (PATH lookup). Tests override this to point at a
    deterministic stub script that emits scripted `policy resolve`
    envelopes.
.PARAMETER Scope
    Scope to pass to `policy resolve --scope`. Defaults to 'default'.
    Workflows pass `type:<type>` when the work item type has been
    resolved upstream.
